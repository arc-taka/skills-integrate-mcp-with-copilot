# Mergington High School Activities API

A super simple FastAPI application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:

   ```
   cd src
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to:
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Data storage

Activities and student registrations are stored in SQLite at
`src/activities.sqlite` by default. The database file is created automatically
when the application starts; no separate database service or migration command
is required. Set `ACTIVITIES_DB_PATH` before starting the application to use a
different database file.

On first startup with an empty database, the application seeds it with the
activities and sample participants defined in `app.py`. Existing database
records are preserved on later startups. Registrations that existed only in
the old in-memory version cannot be recovered after that process has stopped.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |

| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |
| DELETE | `/activities/{activity_name}/unregister?email=student@mergington.edu` | Unregister a student from an activity |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Identified by email in each activity registration.
